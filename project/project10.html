    <h2 class="title">Responding to Climate Change at LaGuardia & Teterboro Airports and Improving Ground Access to JFK Airport</h2>
    <h3 class="a">Group Studio * Jan - Apr 2017</h3>

    <p class="pa">The New York City metropolitan areaâ€™s airports are vital to the transportation and economy of the region.The future operations of some of these airports are vulnerable due to unsustainable planning decisions of the past.Two of the main challenges our airports face are risks associated with the effects of climate change and limited ground connections between the central business district and the airports. These issues will continue to worsen as climate change progresses and traffic congestion increases due to population growth and greater tourist demand.While some visionary proposals for resolving these challenges have been put forth, there have been few if any practicable actions taken toward improving the main resiliency and connectivity challenges the airports face.</p>

    <p class="pa">This report summarizes realistic strategies to adapt to the dynamic transportation landscape of a 21st century city.We propose context- appropriate solutions for climate change adaptation at LaGuardia and Teterboro Airports and innovative ground access improvements for John F. Kennedy Airport.We have consulted with professionals from relevant agencies such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the NewYork City Department ofTransportation and drawn on the research of a number of primary and secondary sources to inform our decision making.</p>

    <p class="pa">Ultimately, the goal of this report is to summarize key actionable changes that should be adopted to enhance the overall functionality of our airports and transportation network.</p>
